[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
We chase misprinted lies
We face the path of time
And yet I fight, and yet I fight this battle all alone
No one to cry to, no place to call home

[Refrain]
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh

[Verse 2]
My gift of self is raped
My privacy is raked
And yet I find, and yet I find repeating in my head
If I can't be my own, I'd feel better dead

[Refrain]
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh

[Guitar Solo]
